  <h1 class="head">Healthy Eating Habits</h1>
  
  <P class="des">The key to a healthy diet is to eat the right amount of calories for how active you are so you balance the energy
    you consume with the energy you use.

    If you eat or drink more than your body needs, you'll put on weight because the energy you do not use is stored as
    fat. If you eat and drink too little, you'll lose weight.

    You should also eat a wide range of foods to make sure you're getting a balanced diet and your body is receiving all
    the nutrients it needs.</P>
  <h3>1.Base your meals on higher fibre starchy carbohydrates</h3>
  <p class="des">Starch carbohydrates should make up just over a third of the food you eat. They include potatoes, bread, rice,
    pasta and cereals.

    Choose higher fibre or wholegrain varieties, such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice or potatoes with their skins on.

    They contain more fibre than white or refined starchy carbohydrates and can help you feel full for longer.
  </p>
  <h3>2.Eat lots of fruit and veg</h3>
  <p class="des">It's recommended that you eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and veg every day. They can be fresh,
    frozen, canned, dried or juiced.</p>
  <h3>3.Eat more fish, including a portion of oily fish</h3>
  <p class="des">Fish is a good source of protein and contains many vitamins and minerals.Aim to eat at least 2 portions of fish a
    week, including at least 1 portion of oily fish.

    Oily fish are high in omega-3 fats, which may help prevent heart disease. </p>
  <h3>3.Cut down on saturated fat and sugar</h3>
  <h3>Saturated fat</h3>
  <p class="des" >You need some fat in your diet, but it's important to pay attention to the amount and type of fat you're eating.

    There are 2 main types of fat: saturated and unsaturated. Too much saturated fat can increase the amount of
    cholesterol in the blood, which increases your risk of developing heart disease.</p>
  <p class="des">Saturated fat is found in many foods, such as:</p>
  <li>fatty cuts of meat</li>
  <li>sausages</li>
  <li>butter</li>
  <li>hard cheese</li>
  <li>cream</li>
  <li>cakes</li>
  <li>biscuits</li>
  <li>lard</li>
  <li>pies</li>
  <h3>Sugar</h3>
  <p class="des" >Regularly consuming foods and drinks high in sugar increases your risk of obesity and tooth decay.Sugary foods and
    drinks are often high in energy (measured in kilojoules or calories), and if consumed too often can contribute to
    weight gain. They can also cause tooth decay, especially if eaten between meals.Free sugars are any sugars added to foods or drinks, or found naturally in honey, syrups and unsweetened fruit juices and smoothies.

    This is the type of sugar you should be cutting down on, rather than the sugar found in fruit and milk.</p>
    <h3>5.Eat less salt: no more than 6g a day for adults</h3>
    <p class="des" >Eating too much salt can raise your blood pressure. People with high blood pressure are more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke.</p>
<h3>6.Get active and be a healthy weight</h3>
<p class="des" >As well as eating healthily, regular exercise may help reduce your risk of getting serious health conditions. It's also important for your overall health and wellbeing</p>
<h3>7.Do not get thirsty</h3>
<p class="des">You need to drink plenty of fluids to stop you getting dehydrated. The government recommends drinking 6 to 8 glasses every day. This is in addition to the fluid you get from the food you eat. 

  All non-alcoholic drinks count, but water, lower fat milk and lower sugar drinks, including tea and coffee, are healthier choices. 
  
  Try to avoid sugary soft and fizzy drinks, as they're high in calories. They're also bad for your teeth. 
  
  Even unsweetened fruit juice and smoothies are high in free sugar.</p>
