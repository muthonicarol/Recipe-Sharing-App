              <li> Irish Potatoes</li>

              <li>Boil green maize for at least two hours or until they are cooked.</li>
              <li>Add the peeled and diced potatoes but do not mix. Place the Kahurura on top of the potatoes after you
                have removed its stem and thoroughly washed the leaves.</li>
              <li>Sprinkle some salt</li>
              <li>Let the mixture boil for another 30 minutes to 45 minutes until the potatoes and the greens are well

                the mixture simmer under low heat.</li>
              <li>Mix and mash the mixture. Add some margarine to give the Mukimo a delicate flavour. Ensure that the
                maize, potatoes and kahurura are evenly spread.</li>
              <li>The final product should have a very fine texture, is light green in colour and should neither be dry
                nor very moist. Some people like it when the maize remains intact(whole).</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Serving Tips</h3>
            <p>Serve with Kachumbari,beef stew or some vegetable soup of your choice. Can also be served with tea in the
